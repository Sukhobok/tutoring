			<b>Cancellation/Refund Policy</b><br />
			Students are entitled to funds being returned to their wallet if a tutor has defrauded them. At end of a tutoring session, the student will have the option to file a complaint if they are dissatisfied with a tutoring session. The student must file the complaint immediately following the session as the sessions are recorded and stored for 2 hours.  The review team at Study Square will watch the session and make a ruling. If we find the tutor did not perform the tasks requested or abandoned the session, the payment will be refunded back to the student’s wallet. If we find the tutor performed the tasks as requested, we will release the funds to the tutor and place the student’s account on suspension for 1 week. The users of www.studysquare.com will be able to request a withdrawal of their funds at any time. Withdrawals will be processed and sent to the user selected method within 48 hours. Methods will consist of wire transfer, check, or PayPal deposit. We will require a w9 form to be on file for all payments being sent from Study Square.<br />
			<br />
			We take steps to ensure all tutors on www.studysquare.com are qualified to tutor. We provide a ratings and feedback area for you to perform due diligence on your own to make sure the tutor fits your needs. <br />
			<br />
			<b>Tutoring Session Disconnect</b><br />
			If either the student or tutor is disconnected from the tutoring session, the session will remain open for 4 hours in a paused state until both parties return to finish the allotted session time.  If after 4 hours pass and the student does not return to the session, the funds will be released to the tutor. The student can file a complaint to have the funds returned, but he will need to provide proof that he tried to contact the tutor to get back into the session and that the tutor ignored the requests.<br />
